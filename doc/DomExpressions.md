Solid implements versertiel implementation for abstracting away UI thru DOM expressions that works incredibly well for DOM, Canvas, SSR, and custom renderer.

I might as well use it instead of reinventing the wheel from scratch.
This could possibly help in implementing custom elements library since
data structures will be already transparently handled by DOM Expressions
across DOM & SSR.
